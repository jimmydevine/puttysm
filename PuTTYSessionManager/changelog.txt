Feature requests:

         PSM from either the options window or the about box.  This 
         feature supports HTTP proxy servers.

         reverts to current user icons      

Bugs:         
1563160: PSM crashes with NRE when empty key is stored in registry. This
         had the effect of making PSM incompatible with TuTTY. Empty keys
         (TuTTY folders) are now silently ignored

         Fixed to kill any version of PSM that is running before installer
